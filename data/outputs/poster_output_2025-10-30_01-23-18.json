However, this approach often overlooks information present in the entire image post-anonymization that can compromise privacy, such as specific locations, objects/items, or unique attributes. Acknowledging the pivotal role of human judgment in anonymity, our study conducts a thorough analysis of perceptual anonymization, exploring its spectral nature and its critical implications for image privacy assessment, particularly in light of regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To facilitate this, we curated a dataset specifically tailored for assessing anonymized images. We introduce a learning-based metric, PerceptAnon, which is tuned to align with the human Perception of Anonymity. PerceptAnon evaluates both original-anonymized image pairs and solely anonymized images. Trained using human annotations, our metric encompasses both anonymized subjects and their contextual backgrounds, thus providing a comprehensive evaluation of privacy vulnerabilities. We envision this work as a milestone for understanding and assessing image anonymization, and establishing a foundation for future research.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) distinguishes 'pseudonymisation'modifying personal data to prevent direct attribution to individuals without additional information-with 'anonymization', where personal identification becomes unfeasible (EDPS, 2021) . Under GDPR, anonymity is achieved when data is processed such that the subject becomes unidentifiable, with masking cited as the most feasible option for images (Weitzenboeck et al., 2022; Barta, 2018) . Current image anonymization techniques, such as masking, blurring, pixelation (Du et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2022) , and generation (Li et al., 2021) , largely align with pseudonymization, focusing on modifying identifiable attributes like faces or full bodies.\"\"\"  # limit text length for efficiency\n\nDetected image placeholders:\nNone\n\nOutput format:\n- Bullet 1\n- Bullet 2\n- ...\n(Keep image placeholders intact)\n```\n\n\n### Introduction\nYou are an expert summarizer for academic research papers.\n\nSummarize the following section: **Introduction**\ninto concise bullet points (3–7 bullets max).\nKeep every image placeholder (like <<Figure_1.png>>) exactly as it appears.\nDo NOT remove or modify them.\n\nSection Text:\n\"\"\"Traditional research in this domain has mostly concentrated on localized areas within images, using detection and reidentification rates for anonymity assessment.
